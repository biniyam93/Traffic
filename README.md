# Traffic Sign Classification

## Experimentation Process

The experimentation process for traffic sign classification began with setting up the environment and organizing the dataset. Initially, I implemented the `load_data` function to read images from the dataset directory, resize them to 30x30 pixels, and store them in a list along with their corresponding labels. This preprocessing step was crucial to ensure uniformity in image dimensions, which is a prerequisite for feeding the data into a convolutional neural network (CNN). I faced some challenges in ensuring that all images were correctly resized and properly read, particularly due to differences in image formats and potential corrupt files. After some debugging and error handling, this part of the process was successfully completed.

Next, I designed the CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model consisted of multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by max-pooling layers and a final dense layer with softmax activation to classify the images into one of 43 categories. During training, I experimented with various configurations, including changing the number of layers, the size of filters, and the dropout rate. I found that increasing the complexity of the model (more layers and filters) generally improved performance, but also led to longer training times and a higher risk of overfitting. A dropout rate of 0.5 in the dense layer helped mitigate overfitting to some extent. The model was trained for 10 epochs, and the accuracy was satisfactory given the constraints. However, further tuning and experimentation with hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, could potentially enhance the model's performance.
